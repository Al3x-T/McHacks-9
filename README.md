Thanks for checking out our project!! 

In the context of the pandemic, when we've been spending more time at home and looking to watch nice movies, we've often found ourselves indecisive and wasting precious time mindlessly scrolling through lists of content. We decided to take matters into our own hands and make a website with a robust yet sophisticated means of providing the ideal movie to watch for each individual.

Choose Me a Movie is a simple website that helps you decide on a movie to watch through a series of questions hand-picked to ensure our users' satisfaction. The site has many advanced features, including a button to return to the previous question and an option for additional recommendations based on the same criteria.
